## Troubleshooting
<details>
<summary> <strong>My mod download stuck when trying to download +500 MB (large size)</strong></summary>
  <br>
  Generally speaking, when the status in download bar is still "Downloading" it means the download is stil not failed. If you're downloading a large mod it will take awhile since there is timeouts between downloads and need to be resumed. But don't worry just wait the download to finish

<details>
<summary> <strong>My download result in "Output: Download Failure" with exit code 0</strong> </summary>
<br>
  This is a known issue if the steamapps folder is corrupted either by moving downloaded mods or something else.
  <br>
  Go to Settings and press "Reset Padma", this will reset Padma including all of it's data to ensure proper fix.
